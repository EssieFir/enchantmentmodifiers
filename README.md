# enchantmodifertextures
Make enchantments act like Tinkers' Modifers
<h4>

Requires [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) or [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net/home) to function

</h4>

Originally made to differentiate Silk Touch & Fortune from each other quickly.

Adds textures for enchantments, which are inspired by the [Tinkers' Construct](https://modrinth.com/mod/tinkers-construct) mod's modifiers

Currently only supports Fortune, Silk Touch & Looting
